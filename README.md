## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI Opponent** using simple heuristics (not random!)
- 💡 **Smart logic** to block, win, or fork based on current state
- 🖥️ Fully client-side — no installs, just click and play
- 🎨 Responsive design — works on desktop and mobile

## 🧠 How the AI Works

The computer uses a set of prioritised rules to decide its next move:
1. **Win** if possible
2. **Block** the player from winning
3. **Take center** if available
4. **Choose a corner** strategically
5. **Fallback to any open side**

This approach makes the AI competitive without being unbeatable — a perfect challenge!
